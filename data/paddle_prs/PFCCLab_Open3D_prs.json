Move unrelated changes, if any, to a separate PR. -->\r\n\r\nThis PR is the part I of integration Paddle to ml module.\r\n\r\nMore details: https://github.com/isl-org/Open3D/issues/7027\r\n\r\nWe don't integrate Paddle unit test to workflow currently (this will be implement at part II). So we provide a method to build from source to reproduce our works.\r\n\r\n### Environment\r\n\r\nimage：registry.baidubce.com/paddlepaddle/paddle:3.0.0b1-gpu-cuda11.8-cudnn8.6-trt8.5\r\n\r\nNOTE: we not verify other environment currently.\r\n\r\n### How to build\r\n\r\n1. update cmake\r\n```bash\r\nwget -nc https://paddle-org.bj.bcebos.com/paddlescience/cmake-3.23.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz\r\ntar -zxvf cmake-3.23.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz\r\nrm -f cmake-3.23.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz\r\nPATH=$PWD/cmake-3.23.0-linux-x86_64/bin:$PATH\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Install dependencies\r\n```bash\r\nutil/install_deps_ubuntu.sh\r\npip install yapf==0.30.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Install nightly-build paddlepaddle-gpu\r\n```bash\r\npip uninstall paddlepaddle-gpu\r\npython -m pip install --pre paddlepaddle-gpu -i https://www.paddlepaddle.org.cn/packages/nightly/cu118/\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. Config\r\n```bash\r\nmkdir build\r\ncd build\r\ncmake  -DBUILD_CUDA_MODULE=ON \\\r\n             -DBUILD_PADDLE_OPS=ON  \\\r\n             -DGLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=ON \\\r\n             -DBUNDLE_OPEN3D_ML=OFF \\\r\n             ..\r\n```\r\n\r\n5. Build\r\n```bash\r\nmake -j8\r\n```\r\n\r\n6. Install\r\n```bash\r\nmake install-pip-package\r\n```\r\n\r\n7. Verify\r\n```bash\r\npython -c \"import open3d.ml.paddle\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe result should be showed as below.\r\n<img width=\"608\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f1ff580-b39b-40f5-9a82-a49b8dafd4eb\">\r\n",
